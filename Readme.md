# Code Tac Toe

Have you seen videos of people playing tic tac toe but with a twist? They have to answer a question before they can place their mark. This is a simple implementation of that idea. Here the questions will be solving problems similar to Advent of Code. You choose the difficulty of the problem and the player who solves the problem first gets to place their mark. Good luck!
